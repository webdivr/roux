App URL:
    http://rouxconferenceproject.herokuapp.com/ 
	
Git URL:
    git@heroku.com:rouxconferenceproject.git	
	
	
Use the following code to set up your app for local development:
git clone git@heroku.com:rouxconferenceproject.git -o heroku	



The following code I lifted from getsatisfaction.com. I did this as I was having difficulty pushing my app to heroku using ray villabos' method.."git push heroku master".

apparently, using this code will make my app visible within heroku
git remote add heroku git@heroku.com:rouxconferenceproject.git

it works!
